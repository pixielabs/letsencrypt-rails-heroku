# 2.0.0 (unreleased)

Thanks to [@mashedkeyboard](https://github.com/mashedkeyboard) for their
work on ACME v2, saving registration, and DNS-based validation.

 - *BREAKING* You must indicate your acceptance of Let's Encrypt's terms
   and conditions by setting the `ACME_TERMS_AGREED` configuration variable.
 - *BREAKING* Removed `ACME_ENDPOINT` environment variable reference. We never
   documented that we support alternative endpoints, and we never tested it,
   and the gem is called *letsencrypt*-rails-heroku, so let's not pretend.
   Please get in touch if you were using this configuration variable, we'd
   like to hear from you! Psst; you can still set `acme_directory` when
   configuring the gem in an initializer.
 - Use version 2 of the ACME API, paving the way for DNS validation.
 - Save private key & key ID variables after registering with Let's Encrypt.
   This will create two new permanent environment variables, `ACME_PRIVATE_KEY`
   and `ACME_KEY_ID`.

# 1.2.1

 - Update `rack` and `nokogiri` dependencies due to reported vulnerabilities
   in those libraries. Note that these don't affect letsencrypt-rails-heroku
   directly.
   [CVE-2018-16471](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-16471),
   [CVE-2016-4658](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-4658),
   [CVE-2017-5029](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-5029),
   [CVE-2018-14404](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-14404),
   [CVE-2017-18258](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-18258),
   [CVE-2017-9050](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-9050).

 - Stop using [jalada/platform-api](https://github.com/jalada/platform-api) 
   because the newer version of the official version supports the API endpoints
   we need now.

# 1.2.0

 - Support SSL Endpoint configuration, as well as the default SNI.

# 1.1.3

 - 1.1.1 wasn't a correct fix for catching redirects during polling, this
   should work better!

# 1.1.2

 - Increase challenge file poll wait time to 60 seconds to match
   [Heroku's limit](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/limits).

# 1.1.1

 - Capture `OpenURI::HTTPRedirect` exceptions when polling for challenge
   filename. Heroku apps configured for zero downtime will be able to respond
   straight away to the request, but will probably respond with a redirect if
   configured with `force_ssl`. Closes issue #41.

# 1.1.0

 - Make `ACME_DOMAIN` optional by using the Heroku API to get a full list of
   configured domains for the app. Useful for apps with lots of domains.
   Configuring `ACME_DOMAIN` is still supported.

# 1.0.0

The major version bump reflects the backwards-incompatible change around how
errors are handled; `abort` vs. custom exception types.

Huge thanks to everyone that contributed to this release, either via raising
issues or submitting pull requests.

 - Raise exceptions on errors, instead of just `abort`ing. This should help
   you catch when your certificate renewal fails, before it expires completely.
   Closes issue #21 and pull request #28. Thanks @abigailmcp!

 - Wait up to 30 seconds for LetsEncrypt to verify a domain challenge. Closes
   issue #6 and pull requests #30, #25 and #7. Thanks @abigailmcp!

 - Attempt to fetch the challenge URL for up to 30 seconds before giving up.
   Closes issue #9 and pull request #28. Thanks @abigailmcp!

# 0.3.0

 - Remove some Rails-specific methods and code to allow the gem to be used
   (with some extra steps) by non-Rails applications like Sinatra. Closes issue
   #14 and pull request #15, thanks @cbetta!

# 0.2.6

 - Add more details of the error returned by LetsEncrypt when a challenge fails.
   Closes pull request #2, thanks @fjg!

# 0.2.5

 - Verify multiple domains individually, fixing support for multiple domains.
   Closes issue #1, thanks @richardvenneman!
